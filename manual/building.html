<H1>6.  Building and running the test rig</H1>


<P>The test rig is a user-mode C program for GNU/Linux operating systems
on 64-bit Intel instruction set CPUs.  The test rig's source code
includes several details specific to 64-bit Intel instruction set
CPUs; the test rig will build only on GNU/Linux platforms with this
kind of CPU.</P>

<P>Test rig makefile's default target will build multiple executables,
one for each example driver.  To build this default target, simply
run:</P>

<PRE>
      make
</PRE>

<P>The makefile has specific targets for each example driver.  To build
an executable for a specific driver, run make with the target named
for that driver, for example:</P>

<PRE>
make test_alpha_0
</PRE>

<P>Researchers can extend the makefile to include similar specific
targets for their own DSL-based driver reimplementations.</P>

<P>Running a test rig executable runs the test suite for the configured
driver.  For example:</P>

<PRE>
      ./test_alpha_0
</PRE>

<P>Note that you will need to terminate the tests for drivers with
deliberate hanging bugs with ctrl-C.</P>


<H2> 6.1.  A warning about debugging</H2>

<P>The test rig's parent tracer process runs the device emulator and
debugs the child tracee process using the Ptrace library.  The parent
tracer receives a signal when the child tracee hits a hardware
watchpoint on its emulated IO register and tries to puzzle out how to
emulate an IO register read or write based mainly on the state of its
simulated NAND storage device.  The child tracee process runs the
driver.  If your driver has a bug that causes the child tracee to
segmentation fault, the child tracee will not dump core.  Instead, the
parent tracer, acting as a debugger, will get a signal indicating the
child tracee has faulted.  The current version of the parent tracer
will misinterpret this signal as watchpoint activation and do
something unhelpful with it.</P>

<P>In the best case, it will drive its emulated storage device into a bug
state, report an error, and halt the test rig.  In the worst case, it
will do <EM>something</EM> to the emulated storage device and wait patiently
for the dead child tracee to proceed, causing the test rig to hang.</P>


<H2>6.2.  A warning about instruction support</H2>

<P>When the child tracee uses a mov instruction to read from the emulated
IO register, the instruction moves the incorrect value present at that
moment in the emulated IO register variable in its memory into one its
general-purpose CPU registers.  It then passes control to the parent
tracer device emulator via the hardware watchpoint.</P>

<P>At that point, the parent tracer device emulator can correct the
contents of the IO register in the child tracee's memory to reflect
the value that would have been there on a real device.  However,
because the CPU has already executed the child tracee's mov
instruction to move the previous incorrect value into one of the child
tracee's general-purpose CPU registers, the parent tracer device
emulator must update the value in that register, as well.</P>

<P>Identifying which register the mov instruction used requires the
parent tracer device emulator to examine and decode the child tracee's
mov instruction.  There are many forms of mov in the IA64 instruction
set.  The current version of the device emulator supports only four
forms: two that GCC used in our tests and two more that seemed to be
likely alternates.  If your compiler uses a different form of mov, the
device emulator will report an error and halt.  The error output will
include the bytes of the unsupported instruction; including those
bytes in a bug report will aid in adding support.</P>
