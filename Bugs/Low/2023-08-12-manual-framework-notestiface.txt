OBSERVED

  The manual describes two styles of framework-driver interface in
  terms of their syntax and semantics.

EXPECTED

  In addition to the above description of the two styles of
  framework-driver interface, the manual ought to also describe the
  tester-framework interface.

ANALYSIS

  The V16 version of the manual presumed that researchers working
  with the NAND use case would care only about the drivers, and so it
  focused mainly on the details of the framework-driver and
  driver-device emulator interfaces.  Since the V16 release several
  V-SPELLS teams have run experiments on the NAND use case that
  focused on other parts of the test rig.  Improving the documentation
  on other parts of the test rig might be useful, and documenting the
  tester-framework interface might be a good first step since the
  differences in its page-boundary semantics and those of the
  framework-driver interface are potentially confusing.  In fact, bug
  2023-08-12-pageboundary documents an example of such confusion in
  the manual itself.

  The use case's mission is to represent the interesting bits of
  *part* of the Linux kernel's raw NAND framework, and those parts are
  essentially the device drivers and their framework-driver and
  driver-device interfaces.  By design, the other parts of the test
  rig don't really resemble the Linux kernel.  If we expand the
  documentation, we need to make the distinction between the parts
  that are meant to be realistic and those that aren't clear.
