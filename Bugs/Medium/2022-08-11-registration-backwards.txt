SUBJECT:

All drivers.

OBSERVED:

Instead of driver calling a framework function to tell the framework
whether it will use a jump table or command interpreter, the framework
calls a driver function to do this.  This is the reverse of the
pattern we want to mimic.

See E-mail thread.

EXPECTED:

Driver registers its jump table or command interpreter with framework
by calling a framework function.
