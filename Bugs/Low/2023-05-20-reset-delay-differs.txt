SUBJECT:

Device emulator pseudocode spec in manual v37 shipped with use case
distro V16.

OBSERVED:

Pseudocode spec for device emulator gpio_set(reset) handler requires
device emulator to (1) clear device state, (2) move device to
MS_INITIAL_STATE, (3) delay (sleep) for RESET_DURATION.  Since the
test rig spends RESET_DURATION sleeping rather than awaiting a
deadline as read, program, and erase operations do, the pseudocode
does not include the otherwise ubiquitous "system clock < deadline"
checks on the transitions out of MS_INITIAL_STATE.

EXPECTED:

Expected reset step (3) to set a deadline like the other operations do
rather than cause the test rig to sleep().  Expected the transitions
from MS_INITIAL_STATE to make the same "system clock < deadline"
checks all of the transitions from other states do.

ANALYSIS:

Note that the device emulator code and its unit tests faithfully
follow the spec as written.

I can't remember why I asked the device emulator to sleep rather than
to set a deadline when I wrote the spec.  The spec as-written may
actually be the best way to do things; this might not actually be a
bug.  But the difference between reset and all the other operations
seems strange enough to merit some analysis, at least.

I discovered this (non?) bug while working on the spec for the test
rig to support the 2023 V-SPELLS TA1 Purdue - TA2 VU - TA3 Yale
end-to-end experiment.
