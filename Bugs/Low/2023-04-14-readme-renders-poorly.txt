SUBJECT:

Repository/distribution root README file.
Possibly all the READMEs in the distribution.

OBSERVED:

When I view the repository README in the GitHub web interface on my
phone, it renders the line breaks from my .txt file *plus* whatever
additional line breaks are needed to wrap the text to fit my narrow
browser window.  The result is visually unappealing and difficult to
read.

EXPECTED:

Word-wrapping should ignore my single line breaks and retain only the
double line breaks between paragraphs so that the content renders in a
readable fashion.

This may be a cause to use GitHub's "Markdown" format... although it
seems odd to abandon the traditional .txt format.
