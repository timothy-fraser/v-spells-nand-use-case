<H1>6.  Building and running the test rig</H1>


<P>The test rig is a user-mode C program for GNU/Linux operating systems
on 64-bit Intel instruction set CPUs.  The test rig's source code
includes several details specific to 64-bit Intel instruction set
CPUs; the test rig will build only on GNU/Linux platforms with this
kind of CPU.</P>

<P>Test rig makefile's default target will build four kinds of executables:

<DL>

<DT> System tests: <DD> The makefile will build one system test
     executable for each driver.  These executables will be
     named <CODE>test_alpha_0</CODE>, <CODE>test_alpha_1</CODE>, and
     so on.  These system tests are the most important executables;
     Subsection 6.1 below describes how to run them.

<DT> Stochastic test oracle unit test: <DD>The system tests have a
     stochastic test (that is, "fuzzing") mode that performs a random
     series of read, write, and erase operations on the emulated
     device and then compares the emulated device's contents to an
     oracle that always indicates the correct contents.  This oracle
     is sufficiently complex to need its own unit
     test, <CODE>test_mirror</CODE>.
    
<DT> Device emulator unit tests: <DD>The makefile will also build a
     collection of unit tests for some key device emulator
     components.  <CODE>test_ioregs</CODE> tests
     the <CODE>ptrace()</CODE>-based debugger logic the device
     emulator uses to simulate IO registers.  This is a good test to
     run first,  particularly if you are running the tests in a
     virtual machine. If this debugger logic doesn't work on your CPU,
     nothing will work.  <CODE>test_device</CODE> tests the device
     emulator component using its IO registers.

    <DT> Alpha driver nand_wait() unit
    tests: <DD> <A HREF="drivers.html">Section 5</A>
    defined a number of timing properties for correct driver
    wait-ready loops.  These timing properties are difficult to
    measure in system tests because of the measurement noise
    introduced by the large amount of computation executed in the full
    test rig.  The Makfile builds a collection of unit
    tests <CODE>test_wait_alpha_[012378]</CODE> that test the correct
    alpha 0 driver and the alpha variants with wait-ready loop bugs in
    isolation.

</DL>
	
To build all of these executables, simply
run:</P>

<PRE>
      make
</PRE>

<P>Researchers can extend the makefile to include similar specific
targets for their own DSL-based driver reimplementations.</P>

<H2>6.1.  Running the system tests</H2>

<P>Each <CODE>test_alpha_?</CODE>, <CODE>test_foxtrot_?</CODE>,
and <CODE>test_kilo_?</CODE> system test executable has two modes
controlled by command-line options:</P>

<DL>
  <DT>--deterministic <DD> runs a short test that covers only a small
      number of execution paths but produces the same results for
      every run.  When run with no command line arugments, the
      executables will choose this mode by default.
      
  <DT>--stochastic n <DD> runs n tests, each consisting of a series
  of read, program (write), and erase operations.

</DL>

<P>For example:</P>

<PRE>
      ./test_alpha_0
      ./test_alpha_0 --deterministic
      ./test_alpha_0 --stochastic 4
</PRE>

<P>Note that you will need to terminate the tests for drivers with
deliberate hanging bugs with ctrl-C.</P>


<H2> 6.2.  A warning about debugging</H2>

<P>The test rig's parent tracer process runs the device emulator and
debugs the child tracee process using the Ptrace library.  The parent
tracer receives a signal when the child tracee hits a hardware
watchpoint on its emulated IO register and tries to puzzle out how to
emulate an IO register read or write based mainly on the state of its
simulated NAND storage device.  The child tracee process runs the
driver.  If your driver has a bug that causes the child tracee to
segmentation fault, the child tracee will not dump core.  Instead, the
parent tracer, acting as a debugger, will get a signal indicating the
child tracee has faulted.  The current version of the parent tracer
will misinterpret this signal as watchpoint activation and do
something unhelpful with it.</P>

<P>In the best case, it will drive its emulated storage device into a bug
state, report an error, and halt the test rig.  In the worst case, it
will do <EM>something</EM> to the emulated storage device and wait patiently
for the dead child tracee to proceed, causing the test rig to hang.</P>


<H2>6.3.  A warning about instruction support</H2>

<P>When the child tracee uses a mov instruction to read from the emulated
IO register, the instruction moves the incorrect value present at that
moment in the emulated IO register variable in its memory into one its
general-purpose CPU registers.  It then passes control to the parent
tracer device emulator via the hardware watchpoint.</P>

<P>At that point, the parent tracer device emulator can correct the
contents of the IO register in the child tracee's memory to reflect
the value that would have been there on a real device.  However,
because the CPU has already executed the child tracee's mov
instruction to move the previous incorrect value into one of the child
tracee's general-purpose CPU registers, the parent tracer device
emulator must update the value in that register, as well.</P>

<P>Identifying which register the mov instruction used requires the
parent tracer device emulator to examine and decode the child tracee's
mov instruction.  There are many forms of mov in the IA64 instruction
set.  The current version of the device emulator supports only four
forms: two that GCC used in our tests and two more that seemed to be
likely alternates.  If your compiler uses a different form of mov, the
device emulator will report an error and halt.  The error output will
include the bytes of the unsupported instruction; including those
bytes in a bug report will aid in adding support.</P>
