<H1>5.  Device drivers</H1>

<P>The corpus of example drivers contains a series of drivers ordered
alphabetically by name: Alpha, Foxtrot, and so on.  The series of names
skips some letters to permit the potential insertion of additional
driver examples in the future.  The "_0" variant of each driver
correctly implements a particular combination of composition and loop
patterns found in real Linux NAND device drivers.  Those with higher
numbers implement flaws.  The following subsections describe the
composition patterns and loop patterns of each _0 driver, the
properties a developer would likely want to prove regarding those
patterns to support an argument that a DSL-based replacement was
compatible with the legacy C version, and describe the bugs in the
accompanying flawed examples that invalidate those properties.</P>

<H2>5.1.  The Alpha driver</H2>

<P>The Alpha_0 driver correctly implements the jump table composition
pattern with the framework.  It transfers data to and from the device
using loop structures that conform to the pattern found most often in
real Linux NAND drivers: a simple loop that decrements a count of
bytes remaining to be transferred and increments a pointer to the
driver-side buffer, similar to the <CODE>readsb()</CODE>
and <CODE>writesb()</CODE> macros from <CODE>asm-generic/io.h</CODE>
used by many real-world drivers.  The data transfer loop structures
have these properties:</P>

<UL>
  <LI> The data transfer loop always terminates.
  <LI> It transfers the requested number of bytes.
  <LI> It transfers them in the proper order.
</UL>
    
<P>The Alpha_0 driver waits for the device to become ready with a
simple loop structure similar to the one found
in <CODE>nand_base.c:nand_gpio_waitrdy()</CODE>, shown
in <A HREF="drivers.html#table10">Table 10</A>.  The loop repeatedly polls the
device's ready status and terminates when the device becomes ready or
the kernel's clock reaches the timeout value.  The wait-ready loop
structure has these properties:</P>

<UL>

<LI> The wait-ready loop always terminates within the
     specified <CODE>wait_interval</CODE>.

<LI> The wait-ready loop terminates and returns a 0 success indication
     if and only if it received a <CODE>DEVICE_READY</CODE> indication
     from <CODE>gpio_get(PN_STATUS)</CODE>.  Otherwise, it returns a
     -1 timeout indication.

<LI> Upon receiving a <CODE>DEVICE_BUSY</CODE> indication
     from <CODE>gpio_get(PN_STATUS)</CODE>, the wait-ready loop either
     (a) causes the driver to sleep for <CODE>POLLING_INTERVAL</CODE>
     or (b) terminates and returns a -1 timeout indication.
  
</UL>
  
<P>The flawed versions of the Alpha driver demonstrate the bugs
described below.  Each one invalidates one or more of the above
properties.</P>

<DL>

<DT>Alpha_1: <DD>Wait-ready loop polls the device with the proper
    timeout but does not sleep.

<DT>Alpha_2: <DD>Wait-ready loop polls the device and returns ready if
    the device returns ready, but it does not compute a timeout time
    or compare the current time to that timeout value.  If the device
    never returns ready it will never time out.

<DT>Alpha_3: <DD>Wait-ready loop incorrectly computes the timeout time
    as simply the timeout interval and not the current time plus the
    timeout interval, thus making the timeout time a moment in the
    distant past.  Wait-ready loop always sleeps for a bit and does at
    least one poll of the device.  Thus in test so long as the device
    rapidly returns ready all will seem well.  However, the loop will
    declare timeout on its first clock comparison and not wait the
    proper timeout value.

<DT>Alpha_4: <DD>The copy is done by an unnecessarily complicated
    nested loop.  The inner loop copies eight bytes at a time.  The
    outer loop runs the inner one the proper number of times if the
    total number of bytes to copy is a multiple of 8.  However, it has
    a bug: if the total number of bytes is not a multiple of 8, it
    fails to copy the last 1-7 bytes.

<DT>Alpha_5: <DD>The copy is done by a similar nested loop that works
    if the total number of bytes to copy is a multiple of 8.  The
    outer loop fails to terminate if the count is not a multiple of 8.

<DT>Alpha_6: <DD>The copy loop stores the bytes read into the
    destination buffer in reverse order.

<DT>Alpha_7: <DD>The wait-ready loop has different behavior depending
    on which operation the driver is waiting to complete, as shown
    in <A HREF="drivers.html#table11">Table 11</A>.  Its behavior is
    correct for erase operations, but it fails to sleep on other
    operations.

<DT>Alpha_8: <DD>The behavior of the unusual nested wait-ready loop
    shown in <A HREF="drivers.html#table11">Table 11</A> also depends on the
    operation.  Its behavior is correct for read and program
    operations, but it never times out on erase operations.

</DL>

<H2>5.2.  The Foxtrot driver</H2>

<p>The Foxtrot driver adds support for processing sequences of
instructions to the basic functionality found in the Alpha driver.
Many real-world drivers provide this functionality in
an <CODE>exec_op()</CODE> function.  The Foxtrot driver implements a
typical command sequence processing loop that iterates through an
operation represented by an array of instructions (ideally) conforming
to the grammar in <A HREF="framework.html#table9">Table 9</A>.  The loop
contains a large switch that dispatches control to a handler for each
kind of instruction.  The <CODE>gpio.c:gpio_nand_exec_op()</CODE>
function provides an example of this pattern.</P>

<P>Foxtrot_0's command interpreter loop structure has the following
properties:</P>

<UL>
<LI> The loop to process all instructions in an operation always
     terminates.

<LI> The loop sends a prefix of the instructions in the operation to
     the device.  It sends them in the same order they appear in the
     operation.  The prefix always begins with the first instruction
     in the operation.  Its length depends on the ready/timeout
     indications of any <CODE>IN_WAIT_READY</CODE> instructions it
     contains.

<LI> Every prefix has one of the two following properties:
  
  <UL>

  <LI> If all <CODE>IN_WAIT_READY</CODE> instructions indicated ready,
       the prefix contains all of the instructions in the operation.

  <LI> Otherwise, the prefix ends with the
       first <CODE>IN_WAIT_READY</CODE> instruction to indicate timeout.
  </UL>
  
</UL>

<P>The flawed versions of the Foxtrot driver demonstrate the bugs
described below.  Each one invalidates one or more of the above
properties.</P>

<DL>

<DT>Foxtrot_1: <DD>The driver copies the operation into a buffer
    before processing them.  The driver's buffer is large enough to
    accommodate reads of a single page, but longer operations get
    truncated and some instructions don't make it to the device.

<DT>Foxtrot_2: <DD>For no good reason, the index for the instruction
    loop gets modded to some N, if there are N or fewer instructions
    in an operation, all will be well.  If there are more than N, it
    will dispatch the first N instructions to the device forever.

</DL>

<H2>5.3.  The Kilo driver</H2>

<P>The Kilo driver updates the DIB with a description of its device and
its capabilities.  A well-formed DIB has these properties:</P>

<UL>
<LI> Its nodes are linked correctly.
<LI> Each node's reference count is set as follows:

  <UL>
  <LI> storage chip nodes: reference count is 1.
  <LI> controller chip nodes: reference count is equal to its number of
       storage chip nodes.
  <LI> device nodes: reference count is its controller chip node plus 1.
  </UL>
    
<LI> The linked list of Device nodes contains no more than 64 nodes.
<LI> Each linked list of Storage Chip nodes contains no more than 8 nodes.
</UL>

<P> The flawed versions of the Kilo driver demonstrate the bugs described
below.  Each one invalidates one or more of the above properties.</P>

<DL>

  <DT> kilo_1: <DD> The framework provides the driver with a
       well-formed initial DIB that already contains some devices.
       The driver has a bug that de-links a device already in the DIB
       upon registration.

  <DT> kilo_2: <DD> The driver links a new Device node, but no
       Controller or Storage nodes.

  <DT> kilo_3: <DD> The driver links a new Device and Controller node,
       but no Storage nodes.

  <DT> kilo_4: <DD> The driver registers itself properly in all
       respects except all reference counts are zero.

  <DT> kilo_5: <DD> The driver registers itself properly in all
       respects except that it incorrectly sets two of the
       Controller-Storage chip node links to <CODE>NULL</CODE>.

<P>Notes:</P>

<DL>

  <DT> <CODE>clock()</CODE> <DD> The Linux kernel maintains a global
       volatile <CODE>jiffies</CODE> variable whose value increases
       monotonically with CPU clock ticks.  Because the test rig runs
       in user rather than kernel mode, its drivers must call
       the <CODE>clock()</CODE> function to emulate reading
       the <CODE>jiffies</CODE> variable.

  <DT> <CODE>wait_interval</CODE> <DD> Callers use
       the <CODE>wait_interval</CODE> parameter to specify the maximum
       number of microseconds the driver should spend in its
       wait-ready loop polling the device before giving up and
       indicating a timeout error condition.

  <DT> <CODE>POLLING_INTERVAL</CODE> <DD>
       The <CODE>POLLING_INTERVAL</CODE> constant is 10 microseconds.
       The driver will sleep for <CODE>POLLING_INTERVAL</CODE>
       microseconds between each poll to avoid putting unnecessary
       load on the CPU.

  <P><EM>Table 11 - Incorrect wait-ready loop structures for Alpha_7

</CENTER>    

<P>These incorrect wait-ready loop structures were inspired by the
unusual wait-ready
function <CODE>hisi504_nand.c:wait_controller_finished()</CODE>.  Both
loop structures consider the operation for which the driver is
waiting.  The correct <CODE>wait_ready()</CODE> function does not
consider the operation and thus its interface provides no parameter to
identify it.  Drivers may instead rely on a global variable to
identify the operation to these buggy wait-ready loop structures.</P>
