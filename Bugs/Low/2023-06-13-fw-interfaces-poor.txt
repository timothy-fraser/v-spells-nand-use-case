    framework/framework.c
    framework/fw_execop.c
    framework/jumptable.c

OBSERVED:

    framework/fw_execop.c and framework/jumptable.c use extern to
    refer to a driver variable declared in framework/framework.c.
    They use this variable to invoke the driver's jumpt table or
    command interpreter functions.

    main/main.c calls framework/framework.c:init_framework() and
    framework/framework.c:init_framework() calls the get_driver()
    function provided by whichever driver is linked to initialize this
    driver variable.

EXPECTED:

    It *might* be better to introduce a new fw_driver.c module that
    encapsulates this variable and provides a function fw_execop.c and
    jumptable.c can call rather than using an extern.
