Use case manual.

OBSERVED:

The design’s definition of desirable properties for the driver
wait-ready loops that manage device timeouts is poor–specifically the
second property:

    On termination, either (a) the device is ready, or (b) the clock
    has ticked through the timeout interval.

EXPECTED:

The design’s definition does not explain the causal relationship
between the ready/busy state of the device and the final indication of
the loop. A better definition might specify that, if the device
becomes ready during the wait interval, the wait loop must terminate
and indicate the driver should proceed. Otherwise, it should terminate
and indicate a timeout error condition.
