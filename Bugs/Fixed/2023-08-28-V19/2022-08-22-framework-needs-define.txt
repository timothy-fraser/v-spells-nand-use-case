SUBJECT:

framework.c:exec_write()
framework.c:exec_read()
framework.c:exec_erase()

OBSERVED:

Each of these functions defines an array of storage device
instructions using an integer literal for its length.

EXPECTED:

There should be a #define for this length and some kind of error
handling if an operation has more than this number of instructions.
