<H1>2.  The test rig debugs itself</H1>

<P>The most unusual aspect of the test rig's design is its use of the
Ptrace process trace library to emulate the semantics of IO registers
and GPIO pins.  The test rig's source code includes several details
specific to 64-bit Intel instruction set CPUs to support this usage;
the test rig will build only on GNU/Linux platforms with this kind of
CPU.  This section explains the need for Ptrace and its impact on the
test rig's design.</P>

<P>During test rig runtime, the device driver interacts with the
device emulator according to a message-passing protocol described
in <A HREF="device.html">Section 3</A>.  This protocol is synchronous;
the device driver makes a request of the device emulator by writing to
an IO register and blocks awaiting its reply.  The device emulator
services the request by writing to an IO register and then blocks
awaiting the next request.  Logically, control passes back and forth
between device driver and device emulator with only one of the two
operating at any given moment.
<A HREF="testrig.html#ioregisters">Subsection 2.1</A>
describes how the test rig uses hardware watchpoints to implement this
message passing through IO registers.</P>

<P>The device emulator does not present any asynchronous or
interrupt-driven IO features to the driver.  When the relative
slowness of device operations forces the driver to sleep until
operations complete, the driver polls the device by getting the state
of a status GPIO pin rather than registering for an interrupt.  A
driver can also reset the device to its initial state by setting the
state of a reset GPIO pin.  <A HREF="testrig.html#gpiopins">Subsection
2.2</A> describes how the test rig uses software breakpoints to
implement the getting and setting of GPIO pin state.</P>

<A NAME="ioregisters">
<H2>2.1.  Emulating IO registers with hardware watchpoints</H2>
</A>

<P>The device emulator presents an interface to device drivers that
consists of three IO registers named command, address, and data.
Logically, each IO register is an unsigned one-byte integer.  All
three are stored in the least significant three bytes of a single
eight-byte static volatile unsigned integer word in the initialized
data segment of the device driver's address space.  The four bytes
listed most- to least-significant are unused, command, address, and
data.  Device drivers send commands and addresses to the emulated
device by writing values to the command and address registers,
respectively.  For example, in C:</P>

<PRE WIDTH="80">
#define COMMAND 0x00FF0000
#define ADDRESS 0x0000FF00
static volatile unsigned int ioregisters = 0;
ioregisters = COMMAND;
ioregisters = ADDRESS;
</PRE>

<P>Similarly, they can read data values from the emulated device by
reading values from the data register.  For example:</P>

<PRE WIDTH="80">
#define MASK_DATA 0x000000FF
unsigned int data = ioregisters & MASK_DATA;
</PRE>

<P>In the real world, the NAND flash storage device would react to each
of the device driver's reads and writes to its registers by performing
some operation.  These operations might change the device's internal
state, change the values of the IO registers, or both.  The test rig
uses the Ptrace process trace library to enable the device emulator to
implement these operations.</P>

<P>On startup, the test rig <CODE>fork()s</CODE> into two nearly
identical processes: the parent tracer process and the child tracee
process.  Neither the parent tracer process nor the child tracee
process call <CODE>execve()</CODE>; they both continue to run
different parts of the same test rig program.  During subsequent
runtime, the parent tracer process executes the test rig's device
emulator logic.  The child tracee executes the remainder of the test
rig's logic, including the device driver.  The diagram in Figure 1
shows the parent tracer as "process one" and the child tracee as
"process two".</P>

<P>The parent tracee process traces (that is, debugs) the child tracee
process.  Although <CODE>fork()</CODE> provides the parent tracer and
child tracee with separate address spaces, they each have an
ioregister variable at the same location in their initialized data
segments.  The parent tracer uses the knowledge of their common
address layout to set a read/write hardware watchpoint on the IO
register variable in the child tracee's address space.  Whenever the
child tracee reads or writes to its IO register variable, this
watchpoint causes it to block and control passes to the parent
tracer.</P>

<P>Upon activation, the parent tracer knows the child tracee's device
driver logic has either read or written some part of its IO register
variable.  The device driver logic presumes the device driver is
following the driver-device message passing protocol correctly and
decides the activation was due to a read or write of a particular
logical register based on its present state.  In cases where the
driver wrote to an IO register, the emulator uses
the <CODE>ptrace()</CODE> function to retrieve the value it wrote from
the child tracee's IO register variable.  In cases where the driver
read from an IO register, the emulator uses the <CODE>ptrace()</CODE>
function twice, once to write the value the driver ought to have seen
to the child tracee's IO register variable, and once to write the same
value to the whichever of the child tracee's general-purpose CPU
registers was involved in the read.</P>

<P>Once done, the parent tracer reactivates the child tracee and blocks
awaiting the next watchpoint or breakpoint activation.</P>

<A NAME="gpiopins">
<H2>2.2.  Emulating GPIO pins with software breakpoints</H2>
</A>

<P>The NAND framework emulator component provides device drivers with
two GPIO pin support functions that, in its source, appear to do
little more than invoke the breakpoint assembly instruction.  Both
take an argument to specify a particular GPIO pin.
The <CODE>gpio_set()</CODE> function takes an additional value
argument that must be 0 or 1.  When the device driver in the child
tracee calls either of these functions, the breakpoints pass control
to the device emulator in the parent tracer.  The device emulator then
uses the ptrace library to emulate the effects of interacting with the
device.  For the <CODE>gpio_set()</CODE> breakpoint, it reads the pin
and value parameters and sets the state of the indicated emulated GPIO
pin accordingly.  For the <CODE>gpio_get()</CODE> breakpoint, it reads
the pin parameter, looks up the emulated state of that pin, and then
sets the value <CODE>gpio_get()</CODE> will return accordingly.  The
parent tracer then reactivates the child tracee and blocks itself
until the next breakpoint or watchpoint activation.</P>
