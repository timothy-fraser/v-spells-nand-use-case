SUBJECT:

Use case manual.

OBSERVED:

The design’s definition of desirable properties for the driver
wait-ready loops that manage device timeouts is poor–specifically the
second property:

    On termination, either (a) the device is ready, or (b) the clock
    has ticked through the timeout interval.

2023-04-22: Furthermore, the manual does not specify actual values for
all of the key timeout constants.

EXPECTED:

The design’s definition does not explain the causal relationship
between the ready/busy state of the device and the final indication of
the loop. A better definition might specify that, if the device
becomes ready during the wait interval, the wait loop must terminate
and indicate the driver should proceed. Otherwise, it should terminate
and indicate a timeout error condition.

2023-04-22: The manual should specify the values of all the key
timeout constants in milliseconds.  For drivers, these constants
include the wait intervals for read, program, and erase operations.
They also include the polling interval to sleep between polls.  For
the device emulator, they include the read page, write page, and erase
block durations.
