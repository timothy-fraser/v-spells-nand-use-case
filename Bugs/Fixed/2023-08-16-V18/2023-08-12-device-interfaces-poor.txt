SUBJECT:

  device/de_device.c
  device/de_cursor.c
  device/de_deadline.c
  device/de_gpio.c

OBSERVED:

  main/main.c declares the ioregisters variable to which drivers must
  write and which the device emulator must watch with watchpoints.
  
  device/de_ioregs.c has an ioregs variable that holds the address of
  ioregisters.  Its watchpoint logic uses this ioregisters variable.

  main/main.c initializes device/de_ioregs/ioregs by calling
  de_device.c/device_init() and passing the address of its ioregisters
  variable as a parameter.
  
  The device emulator modules use extern to provide the ioregs,
  cursor, deadline, and machine_state variables to each other.

EXPECTED:

  In order to have cleaner interfaces with better information-hiding
  characteristics, it might be better to do things this way:

  (1) device/de_ioregs.c owns the ioregisters variable rather than
  main/main.c.

  (2) The device modules provide get/set functions to each other rather
  than relying on externs for the ioregs, cursor, deadline, and
  machine_state variables.

  Note that the above two expectations are arguably separate issues.

ANALYSIS

  The fix to bug 2022-08-22-too-long.txt broke the formerly-huge
  device emulator source into multiple smaller modules, but it didn't
  do the necessary improvements to their interfaces described by this
  bug.
  
  2023-08-16:

  Fixed part (2) of this bug - refactored the device emulator modules
  and gave them clean interfaces without externs.

  Decided not to fix part (1) of this bug.  Began an attempt by moving
  the ioregisters variable from main/main.c to device/de_ioregs.c and
  carried out all the entailed changes to ioregister reads and writes
  in other parts of the system.  These changes caused the compiler to
  use a new flavor of the "mov" assemby instruction that was not
  supported by our disassembler in device/de_ioregs.c Proceeding would
  have required (a) more staring at the Intel programmer's manual to
  learn how to decode the new movs, (b) updating the disassembler to
  handle the new mov instructions, and (c) updating the assembly code
  test cases in device/test_patterns.s.  This seemed like too much
  work given that the fix for part (2) eliminated all the externs.
