OBSERVED:

Manual shows date of original Provatek report.

EXPECTED:

One we're done fixing bugs for the upcoming V17 release, we should
update the date on the manual.  We might consider other changes to
distinguish the updated manual from the V16 version.

For example, we might want to add a new section for authors to specify
some edits done by TJFC LLC.
