Use case manual

OBSERVED:

Use case manual is a PDF file.  This is a binary format, and the Git
source control system works best on text formats that it can easily
diff.  If we update the manual often, I believe the git repository's
history metadata will become bloated with many copies of old versions
of the manual's PDF file.

EXPECTED:

We might be better off if we converted the manual into some kind of
text-based format, if we can find one that will present the pseudocode
and other document elements properly.
