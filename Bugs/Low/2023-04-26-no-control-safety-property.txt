SUBJECT:

Manual.

OBSERVED:

The manual does not list any safety properties concerning the Alpha
driver jump table interface.  In particular, it does not demand any
kind of control-flow safety property: that each slot in the jump table
points to the proper function.

EXPECTED:

Manual ought to include a control-flow safety property for Alpha-style
drivers with jump tables.
