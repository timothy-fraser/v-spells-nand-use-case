SUBJECT:

Manual's description of kilo 6 driver.

OBSERVED:

Drivers aren't bothered by infinite loops in the old DIB because they
add their new devices to the front of the linked list rather than the
end and don't traverse the list.

EXPECTED:

Drivers that didn't check the DIB for well-formedness before adding
their device would try to traverse the infinite loop list and hang.

ANALYSIS:

Given the lateness of the hour, let's remove this buggy driver from
the initial release.
