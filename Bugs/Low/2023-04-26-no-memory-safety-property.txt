SUBJECT:

Manual.

OBSERVED:

The manual's list of desirable properties for driver data transfer
loops does not include a demand for memory safety: that the loop reads
and writes remain within the bounds of their buffer.

Vanderbilt/Mark Wutka's April 2023 experiment with Frama-C sought to
prove such a property.

EXPECTED:

Manual ought to include a memory safety property for data transfer
loops.
