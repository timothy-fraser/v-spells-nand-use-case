SUBJECT:

device/de_ioregs.c
device/de_device.c

OBSERVED:

Out of bounds array reference in buggy framework/fw_execop.c causes
segfault.  Device emulator complains that it got a bad command from
the driver and moves to its bug state.

EXPECTED:

Program reports segmentation violation and terminates.


ANALYSIS:

de_device.c handles signals in order to respond to activations of the
CPU watchpoint de_ioregs.c places on our emulated command register.
Unfortunately, this signal handler also responds to the signal the
test/framework/driver child process sends when it commits a
segmentation violation.  The de_device.c signal handler doesn't
attempt to distinguish segfault signals from watchpoint signals, and
incorrectly reports the segfault signal as some kind of driver-device
protocol error.  This error report is extremely unhelpful, because it
points the developer in the wrong direction.
