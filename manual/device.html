<H1>3.  Device emulator</H1>

<P>The device emulator component of the test rig emulates a simple NAND
flash storage device.  It emphasizes features that impact the design
of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for device drivers and the proofs
that drivers reimplemented in those DSLs remain compatible with the
legacy drivers they intend to replace.  These features include:</P>

<UL>
<LI> message passing between the driver and device via IO registers,
<LI> a protocol where commands, parameters, and data must appear in a
     particular order and with a particular timing, and
<LI> device cursor and cache state variables that are not visible in
     the driver source yet nonetheless impact the results of its
     computations.
</UL>

<P>The device presents drivers with an interface that resembles the one
the Linux kernel presents to its device drivers, as opposed to the
lower-level abstractions described in the data sheets of typical
real-world storage devices:</P>

<UL>
<LI> the device's GPIO pins appear as function calls, and
<LI> the device's Input/Output (IO) registers appear as addresses in
     the device driver's address space that have special properties.
</UL>

<P>The device emulator also exposes some further features that are
typical of real-world NAND flash devices:</P>

<UL>
<LI> its storage is logically divided into regions called erase
     blocks.  These erase blocks contain logical programmable pages,
     which in turn contain storage bytes,
<LI> drivers may read bytes from storage, and
<LI> drivers may write data to unused pages by programming them and
     return used pages to an unused state by erasing entire blocks.
</UL>

<P>The device emulator makes no attempt to emulate further details of
real-world NAND flash devices.  In particular, repeated program
operations do not wear out the storage media.</P>

<P> <A HREF="device.html#statemachine">Subsection 3.1</A> describes
the device in terms of a finite state machine that transitions between
states when prompted by the driver via its GPIO and IO register
interfaces.  <A HREF="device.html#read">Subsection 3.2</A> describes the portion of the message

device.  <A HREF="device.html#reset">Subsection 3.5</A> describes how
the driver determines if the device is ready or busy and how it resets
the device to its initial
state.  <A HREF="device.html#dummy">Subsection 3.6</A> concludes this
section with by explaining the presence of a
special <CODE>c_dummy</CODE> command and how the test rig uses it to
clarify messages that might otherwise be ambiguous.

<A NAME="statemachine">
<H2>3.1.  Device state machine</H2>

<P>The device emulator implements a finite state machine that tracks its
primary state in several private state variables that are not directly
visible to other test rig components.</P>

<DL>

<DT>Storage: <DD>The device emulator's notional storage device
provides 16MB of storage.  This storage is backed by RAM; data stored
does not persist across separate runs of the test rig.  This storage
is logically divided into 256 erase blocks.  These erase blocks are
further divided into 256 programmable pages.  Each programmable page
can store 256 bytes of data.

<DT>Cache: <DD>When the driver asks the device to read data from its
storage, the device slowly reads the data into a cache.  Once the data
is cached, it rapidly serves the data from the cache to the driver.
Similarly, when the driver asks the device to program (that is, write)
data to its storage, the device rapidly receives the data from the
driver into the cache.  Once the data is cached, the driver slowly
programs it to its storage.  The cache is one programmable page in
size.

<DT>Cursor: <DD>The device uses a single cursor to index both its
storage and cache during read and program operations.  This cursor is
a 3-byte-wide unsigned integer.  Logically, the most significant of
these three bytes indicates the erase block, the middle byte indicates
the programmable page, and the least significant byte indicates the
byte in storage.  The cursor's least significant byte also indicates
the byte in the cache.

<DT>Deadline: <DD>In real-world NAND flash devices, operations that
reading data from storage into cache and programming storage from
cache take time to complete.  The emulator provides this timing
feature; the feature uses a deadline state variable remember the
system clock time at which the most recent read or program operation
will complete.

<DT>Machine state: <DD>The device emulator is a state machine that,
once initialized at test rig startup, changes its state only in
response to prompts by the device driver.  The device emulator uses
this variable to keep track of its present machine state.
</DL>

<P>On startup, the test rig initializes the device with all storage
bytes, the cache, and deadline state variables cleared to 0, and
machine state set to <CODE>ms_initial_state</CODE>.  The device driver
component prompts the device to move from machine state to machine
state with one of the following actions:</P>

<UL>
  <LI> a read or write to its ioregisters variable,
  <LI> a call to its <CODE>gpio_get()</CODE> function, or
  <LI> a call to its <CODE>gpio_set()</CODE> function.
</UL>
    
<P>When the driver prompts the device with one of these actions, the
device decides what processing to do based on its current machine
state, does that processing, and moves to a new machine state.</P>

<P><A HREF="device.html#table1">Table 1</A> describes the initial
<CODE>ms_initial_state</CODE> machine state and how the device
responds to driver prompts while in that machine state.  It also
describes an <CODE>ms_bug</CODE> state to aid in driver debugging.
The device enters its <CODE>ms_bug</CODE> machine state when a buggy
driver provides incorrect prompts.  It remains in that machine state
until the driver resets it to its initial state.</P>

<A NAME="read">
<H2>3.2.  Reading data from the device</H2>
</A>

<P>Drivers can read data from the device with the following sequence
of actions:</P>

<OL>
<LI> Set the command IO register to <CODE>c_read_setup</CODE>.  This
     command informs the device that the driver will specify the
     address of the first byte to read in the following three steps.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the erase block to
     read.  This command causes the device to store the block number
     in its private cursor.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the page in that
     block to read.  This command causes the device to store the page
     number in its private cursor.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the first byte in
     that page to read.  This command causes the device to store the
     byte number in its private cursor.  After this third address
     command is complete, the device's cursor contains the entire
     three-byte address of the first byte to read.

<LI> Set the command IO register to <CODE>c_read_execute</CODE>.  This
     command causes the device to begin reading the entire page
     specified by its private cursor into its private cache.  Note
     that it reads the entire page into cache with the page's first
     byte at the cache's first byte, regardless of the value of the
     cursor's byte number byte.

<LI> It takes time for the device to read the entire page into its
     cache.  The device will be busy during the read and return to
     ready once it is complete.  The driver will poll the device's
     status until it becomes ready.

<LI> Once ready, the driver will read the value of the data IO
     register one or more times.  Upon each read, the device will set
     the data IO register to the value of the cache byte corresponding
     to the byte number portion of its cursor, incrementing the cursor
     as it goes to index through the cache.
</OL>
  
<P>The portion of the cache the driver will read depends on how it set
the byte number and how many times it reads from the data IO register.
If the driver sets the byte number to zero, it will begin by reading
the first byte in the cache.  If it sets the byte number to some other
value, it will begin reading somewhere else in the cache.  It reads a
number of cache bytes equal to the number of times it reads the data
IO register.</P>

<P>The device passes through the machine states described
in <A HREF="device.html#table2">Table 2</A> to support this series of
actions.  Once the driver has read the last byte it wishes to read, it
has several options:</P>

<UL>
  
<LI> The driver can read from the next consecutive page by returning
     to step #5 and writing <CODE>c_read_execute</CODE> to the command
     IO register.  When the driver reads the last byte from one page,
     step #7 leaves the cursor pointing to the first byte in the next
     consecutive page. Returning to step #5 causes the device to load
     that next page into its cache.  The device will wrap its cursor
     back to zero if a read increments it beyond the last page
     storage.

<LI> The driver can begin programming pages by writing the
     <CODE>c_program_setup</CODE> command to the command IO register.

<LI> The driver can begin erasing blocks by writing
     the <CODE>c_erase_setup</CODE> command to the command IO
     register.

</UL>

<A NAME="program">
<H2>3.3.  Programming data to the device</H2>
</A>  

<P>The driver can program individual full pages.  The driver may use
the cursor to specify values for only some contiguous run of bytes in
the page.  Bytes not explicitly specified by the driver will be
implicitly zero (0x00).  To program some or all data on a particular
page, the driver makes the following actions:</P>

<OL>
  
<LI> Set the command IO register to <CODE>c_program_setup</CODE>.
     This command informs the device that the driver will specify the
     block and page number of the page it wishes to program and the
     number of the first byte in that page for which it intends to
     specify a value.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the erase block to
     program.  This command causes the device to store the block
     number in its private cursor.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the page in that
     block to program.  This command causes the device to store the
     page number in its private cursor.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the first byte in
     that page for which the driver wishes to specify a value.  This
     command causes the device to store the byte number in its private
     cursor.  After this third address command is complete, the
     device's cursor contains the entire three-byte address of the
     first byte to specify.

<LI> Once ready, the driver will write the value of the data IO
     register one or more times.  Upon each write, the device will set
     the cache byte indicated by the cursor to the value of the data
     IO register, incrementing the cursor as it goes to index through
     the cache.

<LI> Set the command IO register to <CODE>c_program_execute</CODE>.
     This command causes the device to begin programming the entire
     page specified by its private cursor to contain the present
     contents of the cache.  Note that it programs the entire page
     into storage with the page's first byte at the cache's first
     byte, regardless of the value of the cursor's byte number byte.

<LI> It takes time for the device to program the entire page into its
     cache.  The device will be busy during programming and return to
     ready once it is complete.  The driver will poll the device's
     status until it becomes ready before attempting another
     operation.

</OL>

<P>The device passes through the machine states described
in <A HREF="device.html#table3">Table 3</A> to support this series of
actions.  Once the driver has patiently waited for the device to
return to ready status, it has several options:</P>

<UL>

<LI> After the device finishes programming one page in step #7, it
     leaves its cursor pointing to the start of the next consecutive
     page.  The driver can specify values to program to this page by
     returning to step #5 and writing values to the data IO register.
     The device will wrap its cursor back to zero if a program
     increments it beyond the last page of storage.

<LI> The driver can begin reading bytes from the device by writing the
     <CODE>c_read_setup</CODE> command to the command IO register.

<LI> The driver can begin erasing blocks by writing
     the <CODE>c_erase_setup</CODE> command to the command IO
     register.

</UL>

<A NAME="erase">
<H2>3.4.  Erasing device storage blocks</H2>
</A>

<A>The driver can erase all the pages in erase blocks.  This erasure
clears all of the bytes in those pages to all-zeroes (0x00).  To erase
some or all of the erase blocks in storage, the driver makes the
following actions:</A>

<OL>

<LI> Set the command IO register to <CODE>c_erase_setup</CODE>.  This
     command informs the device that the driver will specify the block
     it wishes to erase.

<LI> Set the address IO register to the number of the erase block to
     erase.  This command causes the device to store the block number
     in its private cursor.

<LI> Set the command IO register to <CODE>c_erase_execute</CODE>.
     This command causes the device to begin erasing the entire erase
     block specified by its private cursor.

<LI> It takes time for the device to erase the entire block.  The
     device will be busy during erasure and return to ready once it is
     complete.  The driver will poll the device's status until it
     becomes ready before attempting another operation.

</OL>
  
<P>The device passes through the machine states described
in <A HREF="device.html#table4">Table 4</A> to support this series of
actions.  Once the driver has patiently waited for the device to
return to ready status, it has several options:</P>

<UL>
  
<LI> After the device finishes erasing one block in step #4, it leaves
     its cursor pointing to the start of the next consecutive block.
     The driver can erase the next block by to step #3.  The device
     will wrap its cursor back to zero if an erase increments it
     beyond the last block of storage.

<LI> The driver can begin reading bytes from the device by writing the
     <CODE>c_read_setup</CODE> command to the command IO register.

<LI> The driver can begin programming pages by writing the
  <CODE>c_program_setup</CODE> command to the command IO register.

</UL>

<A NAME="reset">
<H2>3.5.  Distinguishing busy and ready, resetting the device</H2>
</A>

<P>After the driver uses one of the <CODE>_execute</CODE commands to
instruct the device to begin a read, program, or erase operation, the
device will be busy for a considerable amount of time.  As noted in
the previous subsections, the driver must poll the device until it
once again becomes ready before interacting with the device further.
Drivers take the following steps to poll:</A>

<OL>

<LI> Sleep for some driver-specific constant amount of time that
     seems likely to cover most or all of the device's busy period.

<LI> Awaken and use <CODE>get_gpio(pn_status)</CODE> to query the
     status of the device.  If the device is still busy, the driver
     will sleep for a short period of time and repeat this step.  If
     ready, it will complete the polling procedure and move on.
</OL>
  
<P>Buggy drivers may cause the device to enter a confused state from
which it cannot make useful progress.  In these cases, drivers may use
<CODE>set_gpio(pn_reset, 1)</CODE> to cause the device to reset itself
to its initial state.</P>

<A HREF="device.html#table5">Table 5</A> describes how the device
reacts to <CODE>gpio_get()</CODE> and <CODE>gpio_set()</CODE> calls
while it is in any machine state.

<A NAME="dummy">
<H2>3.6.  Note on command IO register</H2>
</A>  

<P>This note explains the lines in several state machine tables that
set the command IO register to <CODE>c_dummy</CODE>.  Ideally, the
driver would be the only component that writes to the command IO
register; the device would read from it, but never write.  Although
our IO register watchpoint activates the device emulator whenever the
driver reads or writes an IO register, it does not inform the device
emulator whether the driver read or wrote an IO register or identify
the IO register involved.  In most cases the device emulator can
deduce those details from its present state and from noting what
register values have changed since it last examined them.  However,
there are some cases where the device emulator must be able to
determine that the driver has written the same command to the command
IO register twice in a row.  The device emulator
writes <CODE>c_dummy</CODE> to the command IO register after the
device writes the command for the first time.  The device emulator can
subsequently deduce that the driver has written that command a second
time when it observes that the command IO register contains that
command again rather than <CODE>c_dummy</CODE>.  This use
of <CODE>c_dummy</CODE> is an artifact of our debugger-based
implementation; it is not meant to represent a feature of real-world
NAND flash storage devices.</P>
