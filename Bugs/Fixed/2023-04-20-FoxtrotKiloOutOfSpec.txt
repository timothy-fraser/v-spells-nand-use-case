SUBJECT:

All foxtrot drivers.
All kilo drivers.


OBSERVED:

The foxtrot and kilo drivers have an exec_op()-like command
interpreter that is a big switch with a case for each kind of
instruction.  Each case uses a separate helper function to do the
actual work.

The helpers for read and write both return -1 if requested length is
greater than page size, otherwise they return the number of bytes
transferred.


EXPECTED:

(Note that this bug asks to bring a correct V16 implementation into
compliance with the updated V17 manual spec.)

The read and write helpers must process rather than refuse to process
requests that cross page boundaries and not attempt to report errors.
The only instruction that may report an error (timeout) and terminate
the loop that processes the instructions in an operation is
IN_WAIT_READY.
