	 * similar behavior.  My Linux's bits/time.h indicates that
	 * clock_t ticks are always microseconds, so rather than
	 * converting microseconds to ticks using CLOCKS_PER_SEC /
	 * 1000000, I'm just adding.  Although I worry that I'm losing
	 * POSIX points by doing so, the simple addition mimics the
	 * pattern real Linux device drivers would use.
