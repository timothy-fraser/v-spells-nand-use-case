OBSERVED:

The argument for NAND_OP_ADDR_INSTR instructions is a pointer to an
array of three address bytes.

2023-06-01 update:

The nand_operation structure has a pointer to an array of
nand_op_instrs rather than having the array itself.  This might be the
sensible thing to do since the number of instructions varies with the
parameters supplied by the test calle, but the exec_read(),
exec_write(), and exec_erase() functions always use a constant length
of 4096.


EXPECTED:

The argument for NAND_OP_ADDR_INSTR instructions should be an array of
three address bytes as part of the address instruction structure, not
a pointer to a separate array.

2023-06-01 update:

The instruction array should either be allocated dynamically based on
the number of instructions needed in a particular situation, or it
should be some fixed maximum length with a constant #defined and noted
in the documentation.  The error behavior if a caller exceeds this
limit should also be documented in this case.
