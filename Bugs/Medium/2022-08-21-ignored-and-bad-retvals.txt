SUBJECT:

framework.c read, write, erase functions.
some driver read, write, erase functions.

OBSERVED:

(1) Some drivers read, write, erase functions return 0 rather than the
    proper length value on success.

(2) The framework read, write, erase functions fail to check the
    return values of the driver read, write, erase functions in their
    per-page/per-block operating loops, and just presume these
    functions succeed.

EXPECTED:

(1) All driver read, write, erase functions should return a meaningful
    length value on success.

(2) The framework read, write, and erase functions should return -1
    when a page or block operaiton fails, just as they do with
    timeouts.
