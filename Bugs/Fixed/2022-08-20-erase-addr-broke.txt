SUBJECT:

Manual table 6 driver-framework jump table interface.
All drivers.
Framework.


OBSERVED:

(1) No spec for erase in manual table.

(2) Present interface asks for a start offset and a length in bytes.

(3) The start and end block computations in jt_erase() and
    exec_erase() appear to arrive at the right answer for the wrong
    reasons.  They divide the start offset ny the number of block on
    the device and the number of pages per block instead of the number
    of pages per block and the number of bytes per page.  There is
    also some unneeded intermediate variables.


EXPECTED:

(1) A description of an erase function in the manual.

(2) Although the read and program functions justifiably ask for a
    start offset and a length in bytes, it seems odd for erase to work
    this way, since it operates on erase blocks and it's not possible
    to start an erase part way through a block.

(3) Correct computations that always hit the start of a block.
