SUBJECT:

All bravo drivers
Makefile

OBSERVED:

The bravo_0 driver can never really be "correct" according to our
desired properties, and the bravo series doesn't demonstrate any new
composition patterns or intentional bugs.  Their only contribution is
their odd wait-ready loop structure, which I now realize is inherently
broken according to our properties.

Alpha_7 and Alpha_8 drivers newly-specified in the V17 manual are absent.

EXPECTED:

No bravo drivers.

Alpha_7 and Alpha_8 drivers present and correct per V17 spec.

ANALYSIS:

This bug is essentially a call to remove the deprecated Bravo driver
series and to replace the interesting parts of the old Bravo series
with the two new Alpha added to the V17 spec.
