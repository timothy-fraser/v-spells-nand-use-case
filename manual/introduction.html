    <TITLE>V-SPELLS Use Case 2 User Manual</TITLE>
  </HEAD><BODY>
<H1>1.  Introduction</H1>

<P>This is the user manual for Provatek, LLC's second "flaw fix via
Domain-Specific Language (DSL)" V-SPELLS use case distribution.  This
use case invites the V-SPELLS research teams to:</P>

<OL>
  <LI> examine a corpus of example legacy C-language device drivers
    for an emulated raw NAND flash storage device that correctly
    implement composition and loop structure patterns commonly found
    in real Linux device drivers,

  <LI> examine a corpus of example legacy device drivers that
    demonstrate common implementation flaws,

  <LI> invent one or more DSLs for implementing such device drivers,
    
  <LI> reimplement the legacy drivers in these new DSLs,
    
  <LI> argue that the new reimplementations are compatible with the
    bug-free legacy drivers, and

  <LI> demonstrate that the DSLs discourage or rule out the kinds of
    flaws found in the buggy legacy drivers.
</OL>

<P>This use case distribution contains a test rig to support these
activities.  The test rig is a user-mode C program for GNU/Linux
operating systems on 64-bit Intel instruction set CPUs.  As shown in
the diagram in <A HREF="introduction.html#figure1">Figure 1</A>, it
consists of four components:</P>

<DL>
  
  <DT>Device emulator: <DD>an emulator for a simple raw NAND storage
      device that presents device drivers with an interface that
      resembles the one that the Linux kernel presents to real device
      drivers.  This interface implements a message-passing
      composition pattern based on Input/Output registers and General
      Purpose Input/Output pins.  <A HREF="device.html">Section 3</A>
      describes this interface in detail.

  <DT>Framework emulator: <DD>an emulator that presents device drivers
      with a collection of interfaces that resemble the ones the Linux
      kernel's NAND framework presents to real device drivers.  Each
      interface implements a different composition pattern: function
      call through a jump table, instruction streams through a command
      interpreter, and modifications to a shared data structure.
      <A HREF="framework.html">Section 4</A> describes these
      interfaces in detail.

  <DT>Device driver: <DD>researchers can use the test rig's makefile
      to build an executable that includes one device driver at a
      time, choosing either one of the examples included in the
      distribution or (with some modification) one of their own
      DSL-based reimplementations.  The corpus of correct device
      drivers demonstrates examples of several loop structure patterns
      common to real device drivers; researchers interested in
      automated program analysis and reasoning may find these to be an
      interesting challenge.  <A HREF="drivers.html">Section 5</A>
      describes these loop structure patterns.  It also provides a
      table that indicates which loop structure and framework
      interface composition patterns each example driver demonstrates.

  <DT>Test suite: <DD>the makefile builds an executable that includes
      a suite of functional tests appropriate for its configured
      device driver.  Researchers can use these tests to demonstrate
      at least partial compatibility between the legacy device drivers
      and their DSL-based replacements.
</DL>

<P><A HREF="testrig.html">Section 2</A> presents the low-level details
of how the device emulator works, how the test rig uses 64-bit Intel
CPU hardware watchpoints and software breakpoints to mimic the
semantics of real IO registers and GPIO pins, and how the test rig
must consequently run as a pair of processes with one using the Ptrace
debugging library to trace the other.  <A HREF="building.html">Section
6</A> concludes this user manual with detailed instructions on
building and executing the test rig.</P>
