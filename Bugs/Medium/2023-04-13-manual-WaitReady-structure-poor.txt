Use case manual.

OBSERVED:

When describing the structure of driver wait-ready loops, the use case
manual lazily refers the Linux nand_gpio_waitrdy() function commonly
used by real drivers rather than specifically enumerating structure
requirements. This laziness appears to have prompted the use case
software developers to implement their wait-ready loops in the same
fashion as those in real Linux NAND drivers: they will not poll the
device if they find the timeout interval has already elapsed before
they begin looping. In their initial P modeling experiment Vanderbilt
University, working from the same design document, modeled their loops
in a different way: they will always poll at least once.

EXPECTED:

The use case manual ought to explicitly describe the structure of
wait-ready loops so that the requirement is clear.
