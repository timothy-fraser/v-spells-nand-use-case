SUBJECT:

All alpha drivers.
All bravo drivers.


OBSERVED:

    alpha0 driver: read buffer and write buffer functions return -1 if
        requested length is greater than page size.  They return
        whatever unsigned int value results from decrementing 0
        otherwise.

    bravo0 driver: read and write both return -1 if requested length
        is greater than page size, otherwise they return the number of
        bytes transferred.

EXPECTED:

(Note that this is partly a fix to V16 bugs and partly to bring a
correct V16 implementation into compliance with the updated V17 manual
spec.)

In all drivers, the buffer read and write functions must be void.
They must process rather than refuse to process requests that cross
page boundaries.
