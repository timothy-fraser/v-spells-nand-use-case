OBSERVED

In jump table section:

   Test suites must take care to ask read_buffer() to read only within the
   bounds of a single emulated NAND storage device page; the device
   emulator will serve read_buffer() requests that cross a page boundary
   but the data it provides for pages beyond the first will not accurately
   reflect what is in its storage. Similarly, they must task care to ask
   write_buffer() to write only within the bounds of a single page.

EXPECTED

   When the test suite asks the framework to read or write buffers
   whose length exceeds one page, the framework must take care to
   break this request into multiple invocations of read_buffer() or
   write_buffer(), each with a length not greater than one page.  As
   in the real world, drivers will execute read_buffer() and
   write_buffer() requests with lengths greater than one page without
   complaint and the device emulator will do <I>something</I> to serve
   them, but the data the device emulator actually reads or writes
   will likely not be what the test suite expects.
