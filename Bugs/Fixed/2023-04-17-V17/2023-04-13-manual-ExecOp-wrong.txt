SUBJECT:

Use case manual.

OBSERVED:

The Foxtrot drivers use command interpreters to process operations,
which are streams of individual instructions. The designâ€™s enumeration
of desirable properties explicitly requires command interpreter loops
to process all instructions in an operation stream.

EXPECTED:

This is not the behavior of the real Linux driver exec-op()
interpreters the Foxtrot drivers emulate. The real exec-op()
interpreters will cease interpreting the instructions in an operation
stream upon encountering a device timeout. This is a design bug; the
design should require the exec-op() behavior.

Note that, fortunately, the actual Foxtrot drivers ignored the design
on this point and implemented the correct exec-op()-like behavior, so
the problem is only in the manual.
