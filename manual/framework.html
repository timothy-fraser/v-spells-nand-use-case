<H1>4.  NAND framework emulator</H1>

<P>The NAND framework emulator provides device drivers with a collection
of interfaces that resemble those the Linux NAND framework and other
parts of the Linux kernel provide to real device drivers.  There are
four interfaces:</P>

<DL>
  
<DT>GPIO functions: <DD>the framework provides drivers with
    the <CODE>gpio_set()</CODE> and <CODE>gpio_get()</CODE> functions
    described in <A HREF="testrig.html">Subsection 2</A>.

<DT>Jump table: <DD>upon initialization, the simplest device drivers
    provide the framework with a jump table of driver operations.  The
    framework then commands the device driver to operate the device by
    invoking these functions through that jump
    table. <A HREF="framework.html#jumptable">Subsection 4.1</A>
    describes this interface further.

<DT>Command interpreter: <DD>instead of a jump table, more complex
    device drivers provide the framework with a pointer to a command
    interpreter function.  The framework then commands the device
    driver to operate the device by providing this command interpreter
    function with a sequence of
    instructions.  <A HREF="framework.html#interpreter">Subsection
    4.2</A> describes this interface further.

<DT>Device Information Base: <DD>the most complex device drivers add a
    subgraph of nodes describing their device and its capabilities to
    a complex graph structure called the Device Information Base
    (DIB).  These device drivers share the DIB with the framework;
    both components are responsible for leaving the DIB in a
    well-formed state after each
    update.  <A HREF="framework.html#dib">Subsection 4.3</A> describes
    this interface further.

</DL>
    
<A NAME="jumptable">
<H2>4.1.  Function call through jump table</H2>
</A>

<A HREF="framework.html#table6">Table 6</A> describes the jump table
functions.  This function call through jump table composition pattern
represents a legacy interface supported by the real-world Linux
kernel's NAND framework; its jump table can be found
in <CODE>mtd/rawnand.h:struct nand_legacy</CODE>.

<P>To operate the emulated NAND storage device, test suites must cause
the framework to call the functions in this jump table in a manner
that follows the driver-device protocol described in Section 3.  For
example, to read data from a pair of two contiguous device pages, the
test suite would make this series of calls through the jump table:</P>

<OL>
  
<LI>One call to <CODE>set_register()</CODE> to set the device's
    command register to <CODE>c_read_setup</CODE>.

<LI> A sequence of three calls to <CODE>set_register()</CODE> to write
     each byte of the three-byte location to begin reading from to the
     device's address register.

<LI> One call to <CODE>set_register()</CODE> to set the device's
     command register to <CODE>c_read_execute</CODE>, prompting the
     device to read the first page of data from its storage to its
     cache.

<LI> One call to <CODE>wait_ready()</CODE> to wait for the device to
     finish reading from storage.

<LI> One call to <CODE>read_buffer()</CODE> to read the first page's
     data from the device's cache into the test suite's buffer.

<LI> One call to <CODE>set_register()</CODE> to set the device to read
     the second page of data from its storage to its cache.

<LI> One call to <CODE>wait_ready()</CODE> to wait for the device to
     finish reading from storage.

<LI> One call to <CODE>read_buffer()</CODE> to read the second page's
     data from the device's cache into the test suite's buffer.

</OL>

<P>Test suites must ask the framework to make a similar series of
calls through the driver's jump table to properly implement write and
erase tasks.</P>

<A NAME="interpreter">
<H2>4.2.  Command interpreter</H2>
</A>

<P>More complex device drivers to provide the framework with a
function that implements an interpreter for operations (that is,
programs) consisting of a series of instructions drawn from a simple
command language and their
arguments.  <A HREF="framework.html#table7">Table 7</A> contains the
grammar for that command language.  Once registered, the framework can
operate the device by calling this parser function and providing it
with an array of commands and arguments in that language.  This
composition pattern represents the <CODE>exec_op()</CODE> functions
that many real-world Linux raw NAND device drivers provide to the
real-world Linux NAND framework.</P>

<P>As with the function call through jump table composition pattern, test
suites must submit operations to the interpreter that follow the
device-driver protocol described in <A HREF="device.html">Section
3</A>. For example, to read data from a pair of two contiguous device
pages, the test suite would submit an operation consisting of this
series of instructions:</P>

<OL>

<LI> <CODE>IN_CMD c_read_setup</CODE> to write
     the <CODE>c_read_setup</CODE> command to the device's command
     register.

<LI> <CODE>IN_ADDR 3, [ block, page, byte ]</CODE> to write the block,
     page and byte parts of the location to begin reading to the
     device's address register.

<LI> <CODE>IN_CMD c_read_execute</CODE> to write
     the <CODE>c_read_execute</CODE> command to the device's command
     register, prompting it to read the first page from storage into
     its cache.

<LI> <CODE>IN_WAIT_READY 100</CODE> to cause the driver to sleep for
     the 100 microseconds it takes for the device to read the first
     page and then poll until the device is ready.

<LI> <CODE>IN_DATA_OUT length bufferaddress</CODE> to cause the driver
     to read <CODE>length</CODE> bytes from the device's data register
     into the test suite buffer starting
     at <CODE>bufferaddress</CODE>.

<LI> <CODE>IN_CMD c_read_execute</CODE> to write
     the <CODE>c_read_execute</CODE> command to the device's command
     register, prompting it to read the second page from storage into
     its cache.

<LI> <CODE>IN_WAIT_READY 100</CODE> to cause the driver to sleep for
     the 100 microseconds it takes for the device to read the second
     page and then poll until the device is ready.

<LI> <CODE>IN_DATA_OUT length bufferaddress</CODE> to cause the driver
     to read <CODE>length</CODE> bytes from the device's data register
     into the test suite buffer starting
     at <CODE>bufferaddress</CODE>.

</OL>

<P>Note that the above grammar permits operations composed of any
instructions in any order.  However, the emulated NAND storage device
expects only certain instructions in certain orders, as described in
<A HREF="device.html">Section 3</A>.  Operations that violate those
expectations will drive the device into a bug state.  Like this
permissive grammar, real-world Linux device
driver <CODE>exec_op()</CODE> functions will accept operations with
incorrectly ordered instructions.  They rely on the NAND framework and
higher-level components to emit operations that will not confuse the
device.</P>

<A NAME="dib">
<H2>4.3.  Shared device information base data structure</H2>
</A>

<P>Only the most complex device drivers will describe their device and
its capabilities by modifying a Driver Information Base (DIB) data
structure that is shared between the device driver and framework
emulator.  Like the Linux kernel's Device Tree (DT), the DIB is a
graph of nodes in links that, to be well-formed, must obey rules
concerning the arrangement of nodes of particular types, the links
between those nodes, and the values of node reference count fields.
Both the device driver and the framework emulator must ensure they
leave the DIB in a well-formed state after modifying it.</P>

<P><A HREF="framework.html#figure2">Figure 2</A> contains a diagram of
an example DIB.  The DIB is a linked list of Device nodes, each
describing a NAND storage device.  Each NAND storage device consists
of exactly one controller chip and one or more storage chips.  The
diagram shows examples of devices with three, two, and one storage
chip.  Each Device node points to one and only one Controller Chip
node.  Each Controller Chip node has a linked list of Storage Chip
nodes.  There are double links from the Controller Chip node to the
first and last nodes in the Storage Chip list.</P>

<P>The nodes themselves have the following fields:</P>

<DL>

<DT>Device: <DD>a pointer to a string containing a make and model name
    for the device.

<DT>Controller chip: <DD>the number of storage chips and a pointer to
    the driver's command interpreter similar to the foxtrot driver.

<DT>Storage chip: <DD>the number of blocks, the number of pages per
    block, and the number of bytes per page.

</DL>

<P>In addition to the fields above and the links shown in the diagram,
each node has a reference count field.</P>

<PRE WIDTH="80">
set_register(register, value)
</PRE>

<P>This function enables the framework to set the emulated NAND
storage device's registers to particular values;
the <CODE>register</CODE> parameter indicates which register,
the <CODE>value</CODE> parameter indicates the value to set.  It has
no return value.</P>

<PRE WIDTH="80">
read_buffer(buffer, length)
</PRE>

<P> This function enables the framework to read data from the emulated
NAND storage device into a buffer.  The <CODE>buffer</CODE> parameter
indicates the buffer to receive the data; the <CODE>length</CODE>
parameter indicates the number of bytes to read.  The test suite
should take care to ask <CODE>read_buffer()</CODE> to read only within
the bounds of a single emulated NAND storage device page;
asking <CODE>read_buffer()</CODE> to cross a page boundary represents
an error that will result in undefined behavior.  This function
returns -1 on error, otherwise the number of bytes read.</P>

<PRE WIDTH="80">
write_buffer(buffer, length)
</PRE>

<P>This function is similar to <CODE>read_buffer()</CODE> except that
it writes data to the device rather than reading data from the device.

<PRE WIDTH="80">
wait_ready(timeout)
</PRE>

<P>This function causes the device driver to poll a busy emulated NAND
storage device until the device becomes ready.  It takes a timeout
interval in microseconds.  This function returns 0 to indicate the
device is ready or -1 to indicate the device did not become ready
within the timeout interval.</P>
